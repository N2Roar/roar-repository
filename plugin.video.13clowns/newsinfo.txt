======[B][COLOR green]SUPPORTED[/COLOR][/B]========

[B][COLOR red]13Clowns[/COLOR][/B] now gives you the option of Lambda Scrapers or Global Srapers!!! Welcome to the swiss army knife of addons, lol. 

For Lambda if you are having trouble with "NO STREAMS" messages you need to ensure that you have providers selected in Lambda Scarpers. Read Below for more information. If they are setup and you are still getting the message it is very possible there is no content availble. 

=======[B]LAMBDA SETUP[/B]========
1. In the settings "Providers" section of addon, Select provider choice to "Lambda Scrapers", then below click on "Open Lambda Scraper Settings"
2. Under "Providers" set "Choose Provider Source" to "Lambda Scrapers" (should be default already)
3. Then below click on "Lambda Scrapers Default Providers"
4. Then on the left click on "Foreign", then click "Enable all Foreign Providers" *optional*
5. If you have a PAID Subscription to Real-Dedrid go to "Derid Only"
5. Then click "Enable All Debrid Providers" 
6. Once all you have selected everything, click "OK". 
7. You have setup Lambda Scrappers. Try it out and "NO STREAMS" should be fixed.
