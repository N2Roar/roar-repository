        <description lang="en_US">Movies, Tv Shows, Anime, and What Not. [CR]See Settings for the Help/About tab. [CR]See bottom of Main Menu for Show Changelog Option. [CR]Providers are now sorted different in the settings and all the best normal ones are enabled. [CR]Disabled by Default: Debrid/Prem/Torr and a 'Sloppy' Stack too, Enable the ones you want from these sections in the settings. [CR]Instead of being confused with all those choices half enabled i decided to go another way. [CR]You enable/disable the ones you dont like and let me handle the broken providers. [CR]How it should be :)</description>
