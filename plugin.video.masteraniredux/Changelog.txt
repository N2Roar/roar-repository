[1.2.2] - 2018-09-11
- Small roll back of the movie change from 1.1.26, as some movies use a different format and therefore throw an error.

[1.2.1] - 2018-09-10
- Fixes Kitsu.

[1.2.0] - 2018-09-08
- Kitsu Library integration!!! SwagOtaku is a bigger MVP than James Harden.
- I noticed that the autoplay changes from 1.1.21 are kind of bugged (MP4Upload is fucking garbage) so for now I'm disabling them.

[1.1.28] - 2018-09-08
- I was made aware that some movies have more than one episode, so it now does it by episode count.

[1.1.27] - 2018-09-06
- The movie change broke favorites, this fixes it, I'm losing my patience with favorites, as soon as Kitsu is implemented I'm seriously considering just deleting them.

[1.1.26] - 2018-09-05
- I noticed that the addon xml had the term "animes" in it, this made me cringe, so I changed it to "anime".
- When you click on a movie it now skips the episode select and goes straight to the player, tbh should have been this way in the first place.

[1.1.25] - 2018-09-04
- Small UI changes.

[1.1.24] - 2018-09-04
- Added a People Watching section, and added more info to Popular Today (SuzwagKururugi arigatou).

- Rolls back on previous changes, caused to many issues to stay like that.

[1.1.22] - 2018-09-01
- Fixes an error that causes it to ask to search again when you add a favorite. 

[1.1.21] - 2018-09-01
- If a host is broken it will now ask you to choose again, or if you are using autoplay it will auto to the next host.
- UX changes, now doesn't give "OK" notifications. Only "Notification" notifications.

[1.1.20] - 2018-08-31
- Fix for Rapidvideo after they updated and broke the resolver. When JSergio fixes this issue I will roll back to using ResolveURL for it.

[1.1.19] - 2018-08-31
- hehe... so the last update kind of broke everything... lol... so anyway I rolled back the json changes but kept the tiwi kiwi update.

[1.1.18] - 2018-08-30
- Tiwi Kiwi now works. Huge thanks to CandyFace. He is the real MVP.
- JSON changes (LOL I'm a fucking idiot.)

[1.1.17] - 2018-08-29
- I'm an idiot and broke search I fixed it now.

[1.1.16] - 2018-08-29

- Added a small change that tells you when there is no results in a search.

[1.1.15] - 2018-08-25
- Changed "Popular Today". Now displays everything there is to offer. Not just 10. This used to be there but now it will not cause an api error.

[1.1.10] - 2018-08-22
- The add-on is now fully compatible with Kodi 18 Leia for now (At least for the time being, let's hope nothing changes). Thanks to Munch (xMunchWasTaken) for this fix.

- Fixed an error where shows with Unicode in the title (eg. Yu☆Gi☆Oh!) couldn't be scraped without throwing an error, you can now watch them fine.
